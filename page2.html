    <h2>Robert</h2>
    <p>I am the Bowser king, my name is John C! This guy is my favorite. When I was born I played with SuperWings. Then I played with PawPatrol and PJ Masks. Next was Rescue Bots and Transformers. After that it was Lego and Hot Wheels. Then I started to play video games. Mario Kart, Mario Odyssey, Zelda, Mario and Sonic Olympic Games, then on my 6th Birthday, Twinny bought me Minecraft and I was hooked. </p><img src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.SEnsKMq0uiQjJ2GGKYMRzgHaHa&pid=Api&P=0&w=154&h=154">

    <h2>Bobby</h2>
    <p>I was born in New Mexico. Then I moved to Las Vegas, Nevada. I liked Lego, Fraggle Rock, and Micro Machines. Then I moved to Arizona. I graduated from Peoria High School then Arizona State University then Grand Canyon University. Then I got married. The best person I have ever known was born in May 2016. Then that guy has been my best friend ever since. Now we have a Bro Page for all of our adventures together.</p>

    <h2>Mariana</h2>
    <p>I am the oldest member of the bro team. But I was the last member to join the bro team. My Pokemon Go name is Murphsohard. I think I'm cool, but the bros think I'm getting there. I play a lot with Robert. I go to sleep early. I love to cook and watch TV even though I steal the remote from Robert. They say I am getting to be awesome. They call me Murph C! I like to play Pokemon a lot of times. I sleep more than bros.</p>
